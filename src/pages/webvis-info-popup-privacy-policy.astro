    <h1>Privacy Policy for Webvis: Info Popup</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: April 08, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>
      Welcome to Webvis: Info Popup! We are committed to protecting your
      privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you
      use our app, a simple informational popup tool designed for Shopify
      stores.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect, store, or process any personal data from customers or
      users of your Shopify store through Webvis: Info Popup. Our app is
      designed solely to display informational popups (e.g., announcements,
      messages, or notices) on your store as configured by you, the merchant. We
      do not access, track, or use any customer data, such as names, email
      addresses, browsing behavior, or purchase history.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information You Provide</h2>
    <p>
      As a Shopify merchant, you may provide us with basic information when
      installing or configuring Webvis: Info Popup, such as your store name or
      the popup content you want to display. This information is used only to
      enable the app’s functionality and is not shared with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      Since we don’t collect customer data, there’s no personal data for us to
      use. Any information you provide as a merchant (e.g., popup content) is
      used exclusively to operate the app and display your chosen messages on
      your Shopify store.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell, trade, or share any personal information with third
      parties because we don’t collect any customer data. The app operates
      entirely within your Shopify environment, and we do not transfer data
      outside of what’s necessary for the app to function.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      Webvis: Info Popup does not use cookies, trackers, or any analytics tools
      to monitor customer activity on your store. Our app is lightweight and
      focused solely on displaying the popups you configure.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      While we don’t collect customer data, we take reasonable steps to protect
      the limited information you provide (e.g., popup settings) from
      unauthorized access or loss. We use Shopify’s secure infrastructure to
      ensure the app operates safely.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Since we don’t collect or store personal data from customers, there’s no
      personal data for individuals to request or manage. If you’re a merchant
      with questions about the app or its configuration, feel free to contact us
      (see below).
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make
      significant changes, we’ll update the “Last Updated” date at the top of
      this page. Please check back periodically to stay informed.
    </p>
